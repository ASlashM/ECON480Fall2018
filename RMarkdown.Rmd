# Manage Your Workflow

### Your Workflow Has A Lot of Moving Parts

- Writing Text
- Managing citations and bibliography
- Performing data analysis
- Making figures and tables 
- Save files for future use 
- Monitor changes in documents 
- Collaborate and share files with coauthors
- Combine all elements into single document for presentation

### The "Office Model"

![The Office Model](msofficemodel.png)

### Your Workflow Has A Lot of Moving Parts

- Writing Text
    - Done in Word, the "realest" part of your workflow 
- Managing citations and bibliography 
    - Often done by hand in Word, perhaps a reference manager plugin
- Performing data analysis 
    - Done in Excel (possibly Stata/SAS/R), then copy/pasted into Word
- Making figures and tables 
    - Done in Excel (possibly Stata/SAS/R), then copy/pasted into Word
- Save files for future use
    - Save Word .docx, Excel .xlsx, etc. 
- Monitor changes in documents
    - Track changes inside Word file
- Collaborate and share files with coauthors
    - Email Word .docx to collaborators, they email back different files, merging, resolving conflicts, etc.
        - `paper.docx`, `paper2.docx`, `paper2comments.docx`, `paper2edits.docx`, `paperfinal?.docx`, etc.
    - Google Docs a vast improvement but at cost of word processing sophistication
- Combine all elements into single document for presentation
    - Copy/paste everything into Word
    - Possibly export as a PDF 
    - Possibly make additional slides in Powerpoint

### Caveats

- "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
- I will only offer suggestions that I:
    - Use myself
    - Will make guides and tutorials for you
    - Can answer your questions about 
- Nothing here is mandatory: if you like your Office model, you can keep it 
- You just probably never realized there are better alternatives

### Your Workflow Has A Lot of Moving Parts

- Why not have them all in a single program and file? *R Markdown* 
    - Writing Text
    - Managing citations and bibliography 
    - Performing data analysis 
    - Making figures and tables 
    - Save files for future use
    - Monitor changes in documents 
    - Collaborate and share files with coauthors\footnote{Collaboration and tracking changes in a system exterto the files would require use of a **version control system** like git}
    - Combine all elements into single document for presentation

### Version Control with Git

- Microsoft Word's *Track Changes* monitors changes made in the .docx file
    - Can't go back in the history of all versions of the file, only recent unaccepted changes
    - Does not back up your files 
- A **version control system** keeps track of changes made in any file, folder, or project specified and backs up files
    - Can look at historical versions saved, revert to them, fork into multiple versions
    - Collaborators can work together on the same or different branches
    
# Making Your Work Reproducible

### Plain Text Data Analysis

- Plain text files are meant to be readable by both machines and humans

### Automate Automate Automate! 

- Make you computer work for you by automating as much as possible
- Minimize error and risk of loss, especially in otherwise repetitive processes

# R Markdown

### Creating a Document

- `File -> New File -> R Markdown...`
- Options: 

![](newrmarkdown.png)

### Document Types

- Two main options: `html` and `pdf`
    - Other types, for presentations: `beamer`, `ioslides`, `slidy` (I use `beamer`)
- `html`: renders a webpage, viewable on any browser
    - the default, easiest to produce and share
    - can create interactive elements (gifs, plots, animations)
    - requires internet connection
- `pdf`: renders a pdf document, viewable in any pdf viewer
    - most common document format around
    - may require `LaTeX` distribution to render 
    - can't create interactive elements


# Structure of a Document

### YAML Header

- The top of a document contains the `YAML`, separated by `---` above and below 
- Contains the metadata about a document, at minimum the `title`, `author`, and `date` (all can be left blank), and the `output` type (which cannot be blank)
    - `output` types: pdf document, html document, pdf slides (beamer), html slides (ioslides, slidy)
- Can be customized extensively (just look at mine)
    - making slides often requires more customization vs. making a pdf/html document 
    
### R Chunks

- You can create a "chunk" of `R` code with three apostrophes above and below your code
    - After the first pair of apostrophes, signify you want to use `R` with `{r}` 
    - You can choose to name your chunk (for your own reference only) with a comma after `r` in the brackets, and then your name (no spaces!)
    - You can then add additional options (with a comma after `r`), frequently used:
        - `echo=TRUE` or `FALSE`, only displays `R` outputs if `FALSE`, also displays the code inputted if `TRUE`
        - `eval=TRUE` or `FALSE`, if you want to display your code, but not run it 
        - `fig.height` and/or `fig.width` = a number, for displaying figures in documents
        - `results=asis` common for exporting tables (like `stargazer` regression outputs) into .tex or html 
    - See [here](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) for a full list
- If you just want to type code into your document/slides (and not run it), one apostrophe on either side of the code, `like this`

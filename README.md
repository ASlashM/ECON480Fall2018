# ECON 480 Fall 2018
Econometrics lectures for Fall 2018 class at Hood College

# For Readers

Each lecture has two files associated with it. 

1. A *.pdf* file, which is an output that most are familiar with. Open with a PDF viewer like Adobe Reader or Preview (for Mac). Using the arrow keys or click through the slides as if they were any PowerPoint presentation. 
2. A *.rmd* file, which is a plain text file used to code these lectures using *R Markdown*. 

You can examine an *.rmd* file in *R Studio* to get a sense of how these slides were produced and compiled. Before we learn more about *R* and *R Markdown*, look for "chunks" of *R* code in the file, indicated by three apostrophes (```{r}). *R* runs the code and produces the results (according to certain options you can control) right in that portion of the document, to be included with the output of the document itself. 

The *.rmd* file is compiled using "knitr" to produce a *.pdf* file. It can easily be told to produce a *.doc* or an *html* webpage instead.

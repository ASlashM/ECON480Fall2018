### We're Not so Good at Statistics: Votes 

- Votes in the U.S. House of Representatives in favor of passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964:

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{tabular}{rr}
  Democrat & Republican\\ \toprule
  61\% & 80\% \\ \bottomrule 
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

- Simple enough: "on average, Republicans tended to vote for passage more than Democrats"

### We're Not so Good at Statistics: Votes II 

- Suppose we break it down further between Dems vs. Reps from Northern vs. Southern states:

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{tabular}{lrr}
   & Democrat & Republican\\ \toprule 
   \multirow{2}{*}{North} & \textcolor{magenta}{94\%} & 85\%\\
  & (145/154) & (138/162)\\ \midrule 
   \multirow{2}{*}{South} & \textcolor{magenta}{7\%} & 0\% \\
   & (7/94) & (0/10)\\ \midrule 
   \multirow{2}{*}{Overall} & 61\% & \textcolor{magenta}{80\%}\\
   & (152/248) &  (138/172)\\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

- In *both* North and South, Democrats are more likely to vote for passage than Republicans, despite a higher proportion of Republicans *overall* voted for the act than Democrats! 

### We're Not so Good at Statistics: Votes III 

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{tabular}{lrr}
   & Democrat & Republican\\ \toprule 
   \multirow{2}{*}{North} & \textcolor{magenta}{94\%} & 85\%\\
  & (145/154) & (138/162)\\ \midrule 
   \multirow{2}{*}{South} & \textcolor{magenta}{7\%} & 0\% \\
   & (7/94) & (0/10)\\ \midrule 
   \multirow{2}{*}{Overall} & 61\% & \textcolor{magenta}{80\%}\\
   & (152/248) &  (138/172)\\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

- A far greater proportion of Democrats at the time were from the South (94/248, 38%) vs. Republicans (10/172, 6%)
- The 7% of southern Democrats voting for the act dragged down the Democrats' overall percentage much more than the 0% of southern Republicans 

### We're Not so Good at Statistics: Kidney Stones 

- Suppose you suffer from kidney stones, your doctor offers you *treatment A* vs. *treatment B*
- In clinical trials, treatment A was effective for a higher overall percentage of patients than treatment B
- But, treatment B was effective for a higher percentage of patients in *both* groups (large and small stones)
- How can this be?

![](redorbluepill.jpg){height=1.75in}

### We're Not so Good at Statistics: Kidney Stones II 

- From a real [medical study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1339981/): 

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{tabular}{lrr}
   & Treatment A & Treatment B\\ \toprule 
   \multirow{2}{*}{Small Stones} & \textcolor{magenta}{93\%} & 87\%\\
  & (81/87) & (234/270)\\ \midrule 
   \multirow{2}{*}{Large Stones} & \textcolor{magenta}{73\%} & 69\% \\
   & (192/263) & (55/80)\\ \midrule 
   \multirow{2}{*}{Overall} & 78\% & \textcolor{magenta}{83\%}\\
   & (273/350) &  (289/350)\\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

- The sizes of the two groups (i.e. who gets A vs B) are *very* different 
- A **lurking variable** in the study is the *severity* of the case: doctors tended to give *B* for less severe cases 

### Simpson's Paradox

\begin{alertblock}{Simpson's Paradox}
The correlation between two variables can change (even reverse!) when additional variables are considered
\end{alertblock}

### We're Not so Good at Statistics: Smoking 

- 1964: U.S. Surgeon General issued a [report](http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/NNBBMQ.pdf) claiming that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer
- Evidence based primarily on *correlations* between cigarette smoking and lung cancer

![](smokingsjwarning.jpg)


### We're Not so Good at Statistics: Smoking II 

![](bigtobaccotestify.jpg){height=2in}

- Tobacco companies attacked the report, naturally

			\begin{itemize}
			  \item But \href{https://priceonomics.com/why-the-father-of-modern-statistics-didnt-believe/}{so did Ronald Fisher, the "father of modern statistics"}
			  \item<2-> There could be a lurking variable (genetics?) that causes \emph{both} lung cancer \emph{and} people wanting to smoke (i.e. nicotine craving)
			  \item<3-> If true: despite correlation between smoking and lung cancner, decision to smoke or not would have \emph{no impact} on whether or not you get lung cancer! 
			\end{itemize}

### We're Not so Good at Statistics: Correlation vs. Causation

- The goal of statistics professors everywhere is for you to learn one thing above all else:
\begin{center}
\alert{Correlation does not imply causation}
\end{center}

- Can NOT conclude *from correlation alone* that $X$ *causes* $Y$
- May be other confounding variables (e.g. $Z$, etc) that affect $X$ and/or $Y$
- May be reverse causation (maybe $Y$ causes $X$, or both cause each other)

![](confoundingturbulence.jpg){height=1.5in}

### We're Not so Good at Statistics: Correlation vs. Causation I 

![](spuriouscorr1.png)

### We're Not so Good at Statistics

- Now you might think that we can never *really* say what causes something...
- It's always good to be skeptical, *but*
- This is where \alert{econometrics} comes in

![](causation.jpg){height=2in}

### Econometrics

- \alert{Econometrics} is the application of statistical and other empirical tools to quantify economic relationships in the real world.
- Uses real data to: 
    * test economic hypotheses
	  *	estimate quantitatively the causal effects between economic variables
	  * make forecasts of future events

![](statsgraphs.jpg){height=1.5in}

### Econometrics

- What we *really* use econometrics for is demonstrating evidence for \alert{causal relationships} between real world entities/forces of interest, and to attempt to *quantify* them, e.g. 
    - "For every additional police officer in a metropolitan district, crime rates decrease by 0.12%, on average"
    - "Each additional year of education tends to increase a person's yearly wages by $2,500, on average"
    - "For every 1% tariffs are lowered, a country's GDP growth rate rises by 0.025%, on average"

### Why Econometrics is Useful: Example 1
\begin{example}
  		Does reducing class size improve elementary school education?	
\end{example}

- Claim: with smaller class sizes, students get more one-on-one attention, learn better

![](smallclass.jpg){height=1.75in}

### Why Econometrics is Useful: Example 1
\begin{example}
  		Does reducing class size improve elementary school education?	
\end{example}

- What is the precise effect of class size on performance? 
- A policy-relevant tradeoff with a budget constraint
- Biases due to wealthy school districts?

![](smallclass.jpg){height=1.75in}

### Why Econometrics is Useful: Example 2
\begin{example}
  		Is there racial discrimination in home mortgage lending?
\end{example}
* Boston Fed: 28% of African-Americans are denied mortgages compared to only 9% of White Americans

![](mortgageapp.jpg){height=2in}

### Why Econometrics is Useful: Example 2
\begin{example}
  		Is there racial discrimination in home mortgage lending?
\end{example}
* What factors determine whether a person is denied a mortgage?
* How many denials are explained *purely* by race, vs. other factors?

![](mortgageapp.jpg){height=2in}

### Why Econometrics is Useful: Example 3
\begin{example}
  How much do state cigarette taxes reduce smoking rates?
\end{example}
* Econ 101: raise price $\implies$ lower quantity consumed
* What is the *price elasticity of demand* for smoking? 

![](smokingwarning.jpg){height=2in}

### Why Econometrics is Useful: Example 3
\begin{example}
  How much do state cigarette taxes reduce smoking rates?
\end{example}
* Low cigarette taxes probably causes more smoking (& vice versa).
* Might more smokers also cause low cigarette taxes?

![](smokingwarning.jpg){height=2in}

### Why Econometrics is Useful: Example 4
\begin{example}
  What will the inflation rate be next year?
\end{example}
* Banks, governments, businesses make forecasts about economic indicators to make future plans 
* This course is less about forecasting

# The Basic Empirical Research Process

### Theory and Data

		\end{tabular}
	\end{column}
\end{columns}

## Economic Theory 

### Economic Theory
* First, we must formulate a question we are interested in answering (harder than you think!)
* Ex: How does education affect wages? Does going to school longer raise your wages? 
* We need a theory to tell us how and why phenomena cause each other! Otherwise all we have are correlations! 

### Economic Theory: External Validity 

* We need a good theory for \alert{external validity} of a study
  - Is what is true of one sample/population true of others? 
	- Lucas (1976) critique: can't base policy off of historical econometric relationships that, when changed, will cause people to change their behavior! 
	
![](externalvalidity.png){height=2in}

### Economic Theory & Economic Models
* Economic theorizing often involves building a formal model to relate economic phenomena and build intuitions	

\begin{example}
		Becker (1968) famously models crime as a rational choice: 
  $$		y = f(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5,x_6,x_7)	$$
	\begin{tabular}{llll} 
		$y$: & hours spent on criminal activities & $x_1$: & hourly ``wage'' of criminal activity\\
		$x_2$: & hourly wage for legal employment & $x_3$: & other income\\
		$x_4$: & probability of getting caught & $x_5$: & probability of conviction if caught\\
		$x_6$: & expected sentence if convicted & $x_7$: & age\\
	\end{tabular}

\end{example}

* We can at least predict the "sign" of each relationship between $y$ and each $x_i$ (then estimate the quantitative impact)

## Econometric Models

### Econometric Models: Basics 

$$	\textcolor<2->{teal}{y} = \textcolor<5->{olive}{\beta_0} + \textcolor<5->{olive}{\beta_1} \textcolor<3->{blue}{x_1} + \textcolor<5->{olive}{\beta_2} \textcolor<3->{blue}{x_2} + \textcolor<6->{magenta}{\epsilon} 	$$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<2-> \textcolor{teal}{$y$} is the \textcolor{teal}{dependent variable} of interest
			\begin{itemize}
				\item AKA ``response variable,'' ``regressand,'' ``Left-hand side (LHS) variable''
			\end{itemize}
		\item<3-> \textcolor{blue}{$x_1$} and \textcolor{blue}{$x_2$} are \textcolor{blue}{independent variables}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item AKA ``explanatory variables,'' ``regressors,'' ``Right-hand side (RHS) variables,'' ``covariates,'' ``control variables''	
			\end{itemize}
		\item<4-> We have observed values of $y$, $x_1$, and $x_2$ \& ``regress $y$ on $x_1$ and $x_2$''
		\item<5-> \textcolor{olive}{$\beta_0, \beta_1,$} and \textcolor{olive}{$\beta_2$} are unknown \textcolor{olive}{parameters} to \emph{estimate}
		\item<6-> \textcolor{magenta}{$\epsilon$} is the \textcolor{magenta}{error term}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item It is \textbf{stochastic} (random) 
				\item We can never measure the error term
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

### Econometric Models: Wage and Education Example 
\begin{example} 
		$$
	wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + \beta_2 expr + \epsilon 	
		$$
\end{example}
- Most of econometrics is about trying to estimate the parameters ("the betas")
- Suppose we (hypothetically) find that:
    * $\hat{\beta_0}=6.2$
    * $\hat{\beta_1}=4.1$
    * $\hat{\beta_2}=7.1$
- Then we can make predictions based on our empirical model of the causal relationship between $X$'s and $Y$

### Econometric Models: Wage and Education Example II 
\begin{example} 
		$$
	\widehat{wage} = 6.2+4.1 educ + 7.1 expr 	
		$$
\end{example}
- Predictions based on our empirical model of the causal relationship between $X$'s and $Y$
    * A year of education (holding experience constant) increases wages by $4.1 thousand 
    * A year of experience (holding education constant) increases wages by $7.1 thousand 
    * For someone with 10 years of education and 3 years of experience, their predicted wage is 

$$\widehat{wage}=6.2+4.1(10)+7.1(3)=\$68.5 \text{ thousand}$$

### Using *R Markdown*

![From \href{https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf}{R Markdown Cheatsheet}](rmd.png)

### Ambitious: Use *R Markdown* to Think About Your Workflow

- \alert{Reproducible research}: you run my code (e.g. the last slide) and you will get the same graph as me, *every time.* 
- \alert{Manage your workflow}: No more copy/paste pictures across 3 programs, 10 files, etc.
    - No more re-run everything and re-copy/paste when you change your data  
    - I can change the axes in the same file as I wrote the slide with my graph, and it will remake the graph in the slide automatically  
- *R Markdown* is a simple human- and machine-readable language:  do *all* your work in one file, export to PDF, Word, HTML, Slides 
- Using *R* is required, *R Markdown* is optional
    - Advanced: version control with GitHub

### York Workflow for Data Analysis 

![Workflow](workflow.png)

- Need software that can import, tidy, analyze, plot, and present data 
- R can do all of this (with *R Markdown*, all in the same document)

### Learning to Code 

- You are literally learning a new language, complete with grammar and syntax rules, and specific vocabulary
- `R` like all command line programming is *very literal*, a single typo or misplaced comma will lead to a different outcome than you intended, or fail completely

### Learning to Code II

# Writing and Saving R Code

### Naming Conventions
- Object names cannot start with a digit or contain a space or comma
- FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AVOID SPACES IN GENERAL
    - You've seen webpages intended to be called `"my webpage in html"` turned into `http://my%20webpage%20in%20html.html`
    - Consider both your `R` objects and your files and folder names on your computer...(`/School/ECON_480_Econometrics/Homeworks_and_Data/`)
- It will be wise to adopt some consistent standard for demarcating names:
```
i.use.snake.case
otherPeopleUseCamelCase
some_people_use_underscores
And_aFew.People_RENOUNCEconvention
```

### Working Directory

- *R* assumes a default (often inconvenient) working directory on your computer
- Find out where *R* currently is pulling or saving files to/from with **getwd()**
- Change the working directory to wherever you plan on keeping your related data and documents with **setwd("filepath")**
    - **filepath** refers to the location of the folder on your computer, e.g. `~/Dropbox/Teaching/Hood College/ECON 480 - Econometrics/Data`
    - OS-specific to Windows vs. Mac vs. Linux

### Writing and Saving R Code: Tips

- Comment, comment, comment! 
  * Use the hashtag `#` to start a comment (`R` ignores everything on that line after the hashtag)
  * Can be made its own line or at the end of lines 
```{r writing, eval=FALSE}
# Run regression of y on x, save as reg1
reg1<-lm(y~x, data=data) #runs regression
summary(reg1$coefficients) #prints coefficients
```
- **Save often!**
    - Better yet, ask me about version control and GitHub (later)

### Writing and Saving R Code

1. \alert{Command line/Console}: writing each command by itself and copying down the result as needed
    - Great for testing individual commands to see what happens
    - Not reproducible! Not saved! NOT RECOMMENDED!
2. \alert{.R files}: A sequence of commands (and hopefully comments) saved as a script, the entire script is run all at once
    - Can test individual commands in command line and then put good commands in *.R* file 
    - Equivalent to a *.do* file for Stata
    - Reproducible, saved, commented

### Writing and Saving R Code II 

3. \alert{R Markdown (*.Rmd*) files}: A plain text document written in *R Markdown* language
    - Allows for individual chunks of *R* code to be run individually (great for testing one command instead of all at once)
    - Reproducible, saved, commented as if a normal document 
    - Can write an entire document (text, equations, R commands, figures, tables, etc) with one file! 
    - Can export to html, MS Word, Beamer, etc!
    - Markdown is a language that is intuitive, simple, human- and machine-readable

### R Studio 

![Rstudio Windows](rstudio.png)

### Agenda for Today and for the Future

- **Today**: practice using the Command Line/Console in *R*
      - Learn different commands and results relevant to data analysis 
      - By the end, saving a script as a *.R* file 
- **Later**: *R Markdown* and the benefits to plain text, literate programming, and workflow management 

### Coding Basics

- First, ecognize that `R` can be used as a simple calculator
```{r calc}
2+2
sqrt(100/4)
log(5)
```
- This will be helpful later when we want to transform variables

### Using Packages

- \alert{Packages} are extensions designed by users 
- Remember, `R` is open source, packages are usually published first on [Github](github.com)
- Official packages distributed and documented through [CRAN](cran.r-project.org/) 
- To use a (previously-installed) package (note the ""): 
```
library("packagename")
```
- If you do not have a package, they are easy to install with (yes, note the plural "s")
```
install.packages("packagename")
```

### Using Packages

- Here is a list of the most important packages you will probably use for things relevant to econometrics

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
  Package name & Use \\ \toprule 
  \texttt{ggplot2} & Rendering beautiful graphics (scatterplots, histograms, etc)\\
  \texttt{stargazer} & Rendering professioanl looking regression output tables\\
  \texttt{dplyr} & Manipulating data much more intuitively\\
  \texttt{sandwich} & More tools for regression, particularly robust SE's\\
  \texttt{tidyverse} & An epic \emph{meta}package of \texttt{ggplot2, dplyr} and other popular packages\\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

- Google each of these for more documentation
- We will explore each of these in more detail later 

# Objects in R

### Vectors

- The simplest data structure in `R` is a \alert{vector}, simply a collection of objects
- To construct a vector, use the "combine/concatenate" function "**c()**"
- **Example**: a vector of the numbers 1 through 5

\onslide<4->
```{r vector 1}
c(1,2,3,4,5)
```

- We can also build vectors via generating series

\onslide<6->
```{r vector 11}
1:5
```

### Vectors II 

- We can perform mathematical operations on a vector as a whole:
```{r vector 3}
sum(1:5)
mean(1:5)
```

### Storing Objects

- `R` is an \alert{object-oriented} programming language 
- We will almost always store data in **objects** and run **functions** on objects
    - Objects are assigned values: `objectname<-value`
    - Functions take the form: `functionname(objectname)`
- Storing a vector as an object called "*x*" using the assignment operator "**<-**" 

\onslide<6->
```{r store vector as x}
x<-c(1,2,3,4,5)
```
- To inspect an object, we simply call it up by name

\onslide<8->
```{r look at x}
x
```

### Storing Objects: Text

- Vectors need not contain only numbers: 

\onslide<2->
```{r vector words}
list<-c("red", "blue", "purple")
```

- Note above, *strings* or *characters* of text require quotation marks around them 
- We can inspect the object via calling it by its name, or more formally, telling *R* to **print()** the contents of the object

\onslide<4->
```{r print list}
list
print(list)
```

### Variable/Data Classes

- Vectors **must** contain the same type of elements (e.g. numerical or text)
  * Technically this refers to **atomic vectors** (nearly all vectors are atomic)
  * There can be a non-atomic vector, known as a **list** (see below)
- Vectors with "mixed" types will convert all elements to the lowest-common denominator, e.g. character
- You can always check the type of vector using **class()**
```{r vector types}
mixed<-c(5, pi, TRUE, 4.3, "cabbage")
class(mixed)
```

### Variable/Data Classes
  - \alert{Numeric} (aka "double"), as it sounds, can perform mathematical operations
```{r numeric, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
numeric<-c(1,2,3,4,5)
```
  - \alert{Logical} is a series of binary elements that can either be TRUE or FALSE

\onslide<2->
```{r logical, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
logical<-c(TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE)
```

  - \alert{Character} is a string of text: letters, numbers, and symbols, cannot perform mathematical operations

\onslide<3->
```{r char, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
character<-c("one","two","7","orange")
```

### Factors 
  - \alert{Factor} is a special type of character variable, often used to indicate membership in one of several possible categories, called **levels** (e.g. for plotting, or conditional statistics and data work)
```{r factors}
students<-factor(c("freshman", "senior", "senior", "junior", "freshman", 
                   "sophomore", "freshman"))
levels(students) #extract unique levels 
nlevels(students) #count the number of levels 
```


### Factors II 

```{r factors2}
table(students) #tabulate number of values for each level 
```

### Changing Variable/Data Classes

- Again, check the type of data with **class()**
- Change the type with **as.classname()**
    - Note you can't turn characters into numeric (if there's no numbers), but you can turn numeric into characters
```{r class change}
class(x)
x<-as.character(x)
class(x)
x<-as.numeric(x)
class(x)
```

### Storing Objects and Indexing

- Use **[square brackets]** to isolate elements of a vector for commands
```{r vector index}
print(list) #Our original list 
list[1] #Inspect first element 
list[c(1,3)] #Inspect first and third elements
```

### Storing Objects and Indexing II 

- Use **[square brackets]** to isolate elements of a vector for commands

```{r list2}
list[2]<-"orange" #Change second element
print(list) #Our new list
```

### Vector Operations

- Keeping our first vector *x*, let's create another object *y*
```{r vector y}
y<-10
```
- Let's create a third object *z*, which is the product of *x* and *y*

\onslide<2->
```{r z is x times y}
z<-x*y
z
```

### Redefining Objects

- Objects and variables maintain their value until they are changed. We can redefine `x` as 6 simply with another command to define `x`. 

```{r redefine x}
x
x<-6
x 
```

### Functions

- Most of R: `functionname(objectname)`
- A \alert{function} produces a (hopefully useful) output based on the input that it recieves. 
- Functions can be recognized by the parentheses () at the end of their names. 
- The `c()` command that produces a vector, was an example of a function.

### Some Useful Functions

- Mathematical/Statistical Functions

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
  Function & Use & Example\\ \toprule
  \texttt{sum()} & Takes the sum of an object & \texttt{sum(1:10)}\\
  \texttt{mean()} & Takes the arithmetic mean of an object & \texttt{mean(1:10)}\\
  \texttt{rnorm()} & Takes a number of draws (e.g. 5) from a normal distribution & \texttt{rnorm(5)}\\
  \texttt{round()} & Rounds an object (e.g. x) to (e.g. 2) decimal places & \texttt{round(x,2)}\\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

- Note functions can have functions in their arguments, e.g. `round(rnorm(5),2)`

# Data Frames

### Data Frames

- The most important object in `R` is a \alert{data frame}, used for statistics, plots, regressions, etc
    - "Rectangular" data (i.e. "spreadsheet"): rows are observations, columns are variables 
    - Can hold variables of different classes
    - All vectors (columns) must have the same length! 

```{r dataframeex}
gapminder
```

### Data Frames: From Scratch

- We often import existing data into a dataframe (see importing data below)
- We could construct a data frame from scratch using **data.frame()**
- Suppose we have 4 different vectors, `v1`, `v2`, `v3`, and `v4`
```{r dataframe}
v1<-c(10,20,30,45,60) # A list of integers
v2<-LETTERS[1:5] # The first 5 letters
v3<-round(rnorm(5),2) #5 random draws from normal distr, rounded to 2 decimal places
v4<-c("Apples","Oranges","Bananas","Kiwi","Watermelon") #Fruits 
mydf<-data.frame(v1,v2,v3,v4) #make dataframe called mydf
```

### Data Frames: From Scratch

- Check the structure of a data frame with `str()`

```{r}
str(mydf) #examine structure
class(mydf) #check it's a dataframe
```

### Data Frames: From Scratch
- Note instead of making the vectors first and then combining them, we could have done it all at once:

```{r, eval=FALSE} 
mydf<-data.frame(v1=c(10,20,30,45,60),
                v2=LETTERS[1:5],
                v3=round(rnorm(5),2),
                v4=c("Apples","Oranges","Bananas","Kiwi","Watermelon"))
```

### Data Frames: Quick Look

- We will use the `gapminder` dataset as a quick example
  * **str()** will give us a sense of the structure

```{r}
library("gapminder")
str(gapminder)
```

### Data Frames: Quick Look

-  **head()** will show us the top 6 rows (observations)

```{r}
head(gapminder)
```

### Data Frames: Quick Look

- **summary()** will give us a summary statistics of each variable (columns)

```{r}
summary(gapminder)
```

### Data Frames: Selecting Columns (Variables)

- Each variable is stored as a part of a data frame that can be called with the `$` sign
    - e.g. with the Diamonds data, price can be called with `Diamonds$price`: 

\onslide<2->
```{r}
summary(gapminder$gdpPercap)
mean(gapminder$gdpPercap)
```

# Quick Data Analysis Example

### Summary Statistics 

- Simple commands can help us learn about a dataset quickly

| Function | Result | 
|---|---|
`min(distr)` | Find minimum value | 
`max(distr)` | Find maximum value |
`range(distr)` | Find the range |
`sort(distr)` | Sort values of distribution from smallest to largest |
|`sort(distr)[1]` | Find first value when sorted (equvalient to finding min) | 
|`sort(distr, decreasing=TRUE)` | Sort from largest to smallest |
|`median(distr)` | Find the median |
|`mean(distr)` | Find the mean | 
|`var(distr)` | Find the variance | 
|`sd(distr)` | Find the standard deviation | 

### Summary Statistics II 

| Function | Result | 
|---|---|
|`table(distr)` | Gives frequency table of categorical variable values | 
|`fivenum(distr)` | Five number summary (min, q1, median, q3, max) |
|`summary(distr)` | Gives min, q1, median, mean, q3, max | 
|`quantile(distr, 0.32)` | Find specific (e.g. 32nd) percentile | 
|`summary(factor(distr))` | Lists all unique values in distr |
|`sum(distr)` | Takes the sum of all values in distr | 

### Summary Statistics: Example

```{r}
summary(gapminder$gdpPercap)
mean(gapminder$pop)
table(gapminder$continent)
```

### Plotting

- Base `R` is very powerful and intuitive to plot, but not very sexy 

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=10, warning=FALSE}
hist(gapminder$gdpPercap)
```

### Plotting II 

- This is where packages (like `ggplot2`) come in, but we'll have to learn later 

```{r histogram, echo=TRUE, fig.height=2, warning=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=gdpPercap))+
  geom_histogram(bins=10, color="black",fill="indianred")+
  xlab("GDP Per Capita")+ylab("Number of Countries")+
  theme_bw()
```

### Plotting III

- Boxplots

```{r boxplot.simple, fig.height=4}
boxplot(gdpPercap~continent,data=gapminder)
```

### Plotting IV

```{r boxplot, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=10}
library("ggplot2")
library("gapminder")
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x=continent,y=gdpPercap ,fill=continent))+ 
    geom_boxplot()+ theme_bw()  
```

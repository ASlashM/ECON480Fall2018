## In LaTeX

```
# Section Heading

This is normal text in a paragraph. This text is \textbf{bold}, and this text is in \emph{italics}. Note the syntax for commands to modify text looks like '\\command{text}'.  

% Comments begin with a percent-sign and are not printed with the document 

## Subsection 

Here is more text. Let's also make a list: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item First item
  \item Second item
\end{itemize}

This time let's make the list numbered instead of bullet points:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item First item
  \item Second item
\end{enumerate}

The best use of \LaTeX{} is for math. We can make really fancy equations, that center on the page with: 

\begin{equation}
		\hat{\beta_1}=\frac{\displaystyle\sum^n_{i=1}(X_i-\bar{X})(Y_i-\bar{Y})}{\displaystyle\sum^n_{i=1}(X_i-\bar{X})^2}
\end{equation}

We can also put math into the same line as text with dollar signs $\frac{2}{3} \times \pi^2$. 

Latex also is useful for creating tables and figures, both are called "float" environments that must be initiated with a "\\begin{floattype}" and ended with a "\\end{floattype}", e.g.: 

\begin{table}[h!] % h! places the table here in the doc, instead of where latex optimizes the location
  \begin{tabular}{lcr} %to create three columns, the first left-aligned (l), the second center-aligned (c), the third right aligned (r)\\ % all lines must end with \\
  c & l & r \\ \hline % hline creates a horizontal line 
  Example 1 & Example 2 & Example 3\\
  44 & 66 & 88 \\ \hline 
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
